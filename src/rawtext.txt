So often, baseball media and fans find reasons to dunk on MLB. We‚Äôre as guilty as anyone! But when they‚Äôre right, they‚Äôre right. Thank you Commissioner Manfred and the 30 Major League Baseball principal owners.
Easter Eggs on the hats, too üëÄüëÄüëÄ https://t.co/5edFi70Dkz.
And the rest of the design? So modern. An ode to the core demographic of MLB fans right now: people who thought they found their career calling after screenprinting a t-shirt in their 7th grade Graphic Design class üíØüíØüíØ.
The way that 30% of it is just white space? It‚Äôs eerily reminiscent of how the founding fathers left 30% of the constitution up for interpretation. These hats really nail it on every level.
Stars and Stripes. So proud to be an American. Thank you to the fine folks from the Jersey Shore who MLB contracted to design these hats. They nailed it this time. Sometimes you just have to tip your cap to the ol‚Äô Major League Baseball https://t.co/FPufDbBhFB.

@whygilbert saving that for the highest patrons, like wu tang did with that album that Martin Shkreli bought.
one of those "other really cool things" is happening this Tuesday ‚Äî a live hangout/Q&amp;A for our top-tier patrons, where we can chat about anything baseball or non-baseball, including how we make the podcast, Alex's best and worst music takes, etc. etc..
this conversation was built off the Tipping Pitches newsletter that Alex wrote last week. as a reminder, you can get access to our newsletter (+ a lot of other really cool things) by signing up for our Patreon here: https://t.co/KDhFKoOjaB https://t.co/1OT3rAwuiO.
if none of that sounds fun to you, well, we also started by talking about our favorite moments in baseball twitter history. so, there's a little something for everyone.
then, just hours after we stopped recording, a story started going around that a handful of Rays players refused to wear the team's pride logos on their jerseys!   MLB: it's not a place for politics, really.
earlier this week, we discussed gabe kapler and chris woodward and the rangers and ron desantis, but really we discussed the state of the sports political machine and how hypocritical it is  you can listen wherever you get podcasts: https://t.co/vjNmqI8RCD.

Last week, Rangers manager Chris Woodward said he didn't see conversations about gun violence as a political issue.  In this week's newsletter, we talked about the limits of apoliticism in a sport whose culture is defined by politics. Subscribe to read: https://t.co/KDhFKoOjaB https://t.co/z9J3qgKuDK.
anyway, most kids in America don't even have access to baseball, let alone the context for your little jab about someone giving the finger on a baseball field. so, maybe let the kids play, idk.
I don't think most people who throw that term back in peoples' faces with snark even stop to think about the intent of a phrase like that. "Let the kids play" could've been about so much more than just bat flips, but instead we're still litigating fucking decorum.
I remember being excited about "Let the kids play" when it first started, because you could imagine a world in which it became a rallying cry to make it easier for kids to play baseball. Years later, it's a culture war shorthand for anything old people don't like about the game.
can you imagine if after the Bill Bucker play they were just like "ok, grab a couple orange slices and get back in there, boys" https://t.co/1D77En0Reb.
@HowieRose Not sure why you would equate something like this with ‚ÄúLet the kids play,‚Äù a slogan developed by MLB to support young players (mostly of color) who celebrate home runs by showing emotion. Seems like you‚Äôre trying to imply causation, which is pretty damn lazy and irresponsible!.

@Dan_Alper this is just a bunch of buzz words that don't mean anything.
@Dan_Alper the Rangers spent less than $100m on payroll last year and are at $145m this year. that's $114m and $85 million under the CBT threshold, respectively. whatever "finite budget" you think you're talking about isn't anywhere near exhausted.

I have no idea whether they'll come to an agreement, and I have no opinion on what contract Aaron Judge should or should not sign, but this is a pretty awful confluence of events if your goal is to keep a healthy relationship with your superstar.
From a process perspective, this is about as bad as it gets:  Failed to settle arb -&gt; Failed to reach extension before the season -&gt; Leaked the exact terms of the failed extension -&gt; Have to trash him at arb and continue extension negotiations at the same time https://t.co/Sw6tLB5szv.

We've enjoyed doing (almost) every episode of this show, dating all the way back to 2017. If you've enjoyed listening, all we ask is that you take a peek at the Patreon and consider it! We absolutely do not lament anyone who does not sign up.
We are frankly kind of stunned at the support that people have shown us so far ‚Äî it's been incredibly validating. More than that, it's been motivating. We want to keep making a show everyone likes, and hopefully start making even more of it in the near future.
