@CespedesBBQ I do, thanks to what I‚Äôm sure @megrowler sees as the most important blog she‚Äôs ever written.
Wow, @RichardStaff with the coveted Baseball Crank retweet. Still waiting on that Heritage Foundation endorsement https://t.co/7B613gaMYa.
‚ÄúHigh payroll = high expectations‚Äù  Sure, but that‚Äôs owner speak. And it‚Äôs not as simple as that. The individual contracts that make up the $229m are mostly fair, market-rate contracts. It‚Äôs not the salaries‚Äô faults that Dombrowski decided defense didn‚Äôt matter.
nobody cares about John Middleton‚Äôs money https://t.co/6apuMX1lAr.

leaving Jim Kaat in the booth must be some kind of decades-long psychology experiment that no one knows about. baseball fans writ large are participating in a study, and I can only hope our stipend is lucrative.
@lindseyadler he's a big fan, yes. thank you labor king Shohei Ohtani.

to me, the funniest part of umpire discourse is that the automated strike zone would do nothing to fix something like this, which is clearly the worst impact umpires have on baseball https://t.co/t1usachFlp.

crew chief review is so much worse than challenge review. instant replay is a crime against baseball history.
in the span of an inning the Phillies broadcast has left four pitches‚Äô worth of silence and also whined about the shift üòê.
gary, keith and ron have lapped the competition so many times lol.
few things in baseball are more torturous than watching your favorite team with the opposing team‚Äôs broadcast.
