@CespedesBBQ I do, thanks to what I’m sure @megrowler sees as the most important blog she’s ever written
Wow, @RichardStaff with the coveted Baseball Crank retweet. Still waiting on that Heritage Foundation endorsement https://t.co/7B613gaMYa
“High payroll = high expectations”

Sure, but that’s owner speak. And it’s not as simple as that. The individual contracts that make up the $229m are mostly fair, market-rate contracts. It’s not the salaries’ faults that Dombrowski decided defense didn’t matter

leaving Jim Kaat in the booth must be some kind of decades-long psychology experiment that no one knows about. baseball fans writ large are participating in a study, and I can only hope our stipend is lucrative

to me, the funniest part of umpire discourse is that the automated strike zone would do nothing to fix something like this, which is clearly the worst impact umpires have on baseball https://t.co/t1usachFlp

crew chief review is so much worse than challenge review. instant replay is a crime against baseball history
in the span of an inning the Phillies broadcast has left four pitches’ worth of silence and also whined about the shift 😐
gary, keith and ron have lapped the competition so many times lol
few things in baseball are more torturous than watching your favorite team with the opposing team’s broadcast
